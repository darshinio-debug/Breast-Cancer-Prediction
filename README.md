# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
An end-to-end machine learning workflow for diagnosing breast cancer using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.  The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), PCA for dimensionality reduction,  and classification using Logistic Regression, SVM, LDA, and Random Forest, Evaluation metrics. 

# 🩺 Breast Cancer Classification using PCA + ML Models

This project applies machine learning techniques to classify breast cancer tumors 
as **Benign (B)** or **Malignant (M)** using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

The workflow includes:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Standardization
- Dimensionality Reduction using PCA
- Machine Learning Models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine
  - Linear Discriminant Analysis
  - Random Forest
- Evaluation using:
  - Accuracy
  - Confusion Matrix
  - ROC Curve + AUC
- Final comparison and summary
